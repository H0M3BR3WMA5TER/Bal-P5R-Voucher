This texture mod is a drag-n-drop replacement for the vouchers Tarot Merchant and Tarot Tycoon that are in the style that is alongside the mod: Persona 5 Custom Tarot Cards.
This mod is found on NexusMods at https://www.nexusmods.com/balatro/mods/99.
I may make another version thats more inline with the diamond background of the tarot cards soon. Enjoy!
